/**
 * This the Scroll interface used to define the abstract implementations and exceptions.
 * A scroll is a data structure similar to a list in that it stores elements in a sequence. However, a scroll
 * keeps track of a position in the sequence that we will call the "cursor".
 * A scroll can be depicted using two side-by-side sequences - a left sequence
 * and a right sequenceThe position between the left sequence and the right sequence is the cursor position.
 * The cursor position can be at the beginning of the scroll, at the end of a scroll,
 * or between to elements in the scroll. We say that the elements to the left of the cursor are before the cursor,
 * while the elements to its right are after the cursor
